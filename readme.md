# Background
I'm a 'casual/hardcore' gamer, I guess. I'm also a big wrestling fan, so playing wrestling games is a natural hobby to have
for someone such as myself, right?


# Project
This project is designed to be a CRUD+ web application, which augments the WWE 2k (18) video game series' 'Universe' mode.

With this app, you'll be able to keep track of your shows, roster, championships and championship (roman) reigns throughout your save, and other miscellaneous crap.

I also endeavour to implement additional features not found in the game, such as Draft mode, and G1-style round-robin tournaments.

# Feedback
If you somehow happen to come across this repository, and are interested in seeing more features, I'll be happy to accommodate, time permitting.

This project formerly existed under 'https://github.com/mike-pratt/wwe2kcompanionapi-legacy', however I decided to create a new
repository, as I screwed the old repo up by including a reference to the frontend application, thus when discarding api files,
it would also remove any uncommited frontend changes (grrr). In the end it was easier to create a fresh repository. 
If you wish to see older commits, visit the link above (though it's currently private :P).
